I am a Ph.D. student in [Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University](http://stat.cmu.edu/), fortunate to be advised by [Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla](https://arun-kuchibhotla.github.io). My primary research interests include statistics, machine learning, and probability, with a focus on developing statistical methods for uncertainty quantification. My research topics encompass:

* Conformal Inference
* Assumption-Lean Inference
* Asymptotic Theory
* Optimization Theory
* Non-standard parametric inference


Before joining CMU, I earned my bachelor's degree in 2018 and master's degree in 2020 from the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/). In the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to visit Duke University, where I was hosted by [Alexander Volfovsky](https://volfovsky.github.io/).

In Fall 2025, I will be joining Meta's [Central Applied Science](https://research.facebook.com/teams/cas/) team as a Research Scientist.
